The above given dataset is a statistics of 21018 IPL Matches, wherein i have performed Clustering Using K-Means Algorithm.

What is MinMaxScaler?
The MinMaxScaler is the probably the most famous scaling algorithm, and follows the following formula for each feature:
(xi–min(x))/(max(x)–min(x))

It essentially shrinks the range such that the range is now between 0 and 1 (or -1 to 1 if there are negative values).
This scaler works better for cases in which the standard scaler might not work so well. If the distribution is not Gaussian or the standard deviation is very small, the min-max scaler works better.

What is PCA?
Principal Components Analysis is an unsupervised learning class of statistical techniques used to explain data in high dimension using smaller number of variables called the principal components.
In PCA, we compute the principal component and used the to explain the data.

What is Elbow Method?
A fundamental step for any unsupervised algorithm is to determine the optimal number of clusters into which the data may be clustered. The Elbow Method is one of the most popular methods to determine this optimal value of k.
